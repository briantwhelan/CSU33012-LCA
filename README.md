# CSU33012-LCA
##Overview
I have implemented the LCA algorithm in both Java and Python, with Python being a language I had never used previously. For my Java implementation, I used JUnit to test my code, while for the Python implementation I used pytest.

##My Approach
My approach was to build a binary search tree data structure in a test-driven manner and then implement a simple LCA algorithm on this data structure. I focused on doing all of this is a test-driven manner, making the tests first and then working on the actual code to pass the tests.  My Python implementation was basically a translation of my Java code, which was challenging in itself given how unfamiliar I was with the python syntax.
